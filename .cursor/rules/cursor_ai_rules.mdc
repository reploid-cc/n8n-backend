## 1. General Principles
1. **Confirm requests**: AI must always repeat and confirm the initial request before executing.  
2. **Maintain transparency**: Report every action step to the user.  
3. **Ask for feedback promptly** when:
   - Scope is exceeded  
   - A decision is needed beyond authority  
   - A better solution is found  
4. **No meaningless interruptions**: AI should only pause in situations listed in item 3.

## 2. Workflow Process

### 2.1 Define Goals & Scope
- Match requests against the agreed scope.  
- Immediately notify if any conflict is found.

### 2.2 Planning
- Break down tasks into clear steps.  
- Assign tasks to appropriate modules/nodes.  
- Set checkpoints for progress monitoring.

### 2.3 Preparation & Environment Checks
- **Always** read configuration from the official `.env` file.  
- `env.txt` is only for reference structure, **not** for execution.

### 2.4 Execution
- Strictly follow the approved plan.  
- Update progress at important checkpoints with timestamps.

### 2.5 Report Results
- Present results compared to initial goals.  
- Summarize difficulties and how they were resolved.  
- Document lessons learned.

## 3. Environment Management (.env)
1. **Do not create or modify** the `.env` or `.env.*` file without permission.  
2. If new variables/fields are needed:
   - Update `env.md` or `env.*.md` 
   - Notify the user to update the official `.env` or `.env.*`
3. **Pause workflow** until `.env` is updated and user confirms.  
4. **Example Process**:
   1. Detect missing variable ‚Üí AI creates Pull Request or detailed report  
   2. Wait for the user to update `.env` or `.env.*`
   3. Resume upon receiving confirmation
